  As an undergraduate student in Computer Engineering, I possess strong technical expertise in
  programming languages such as Python, SQL, and JavaScript. I am proficient in frameworks and
  technologies, including NoSQL, Tableau, Node.js, and React, with hands-on experience using developer
  tools like Git, MySQL, MongoDB, VS Code, Linux, and web development technologies (HTML, CSS).
  My analytical skills are complemented by proficiency in data manipulation and visualization libraries
  such as Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn, enabling me to tackle complex data science and
  engineering challenges effectively.<br>
